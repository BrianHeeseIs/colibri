# Ultrawork Notepad — colibri M4 moe_batch (prefill lane) + startup lane
Started: 2026-08-14T01:26 Europe/Amsterdam

## Mandate
User: "keep working until you can't continue at all without my input."
Save ALL questions for tomorrow's "good morning"/"good afternoon" -> ask via question tool then.
=> DO NOT block on questions. Log them under ## Questions For User and keep going.

## Findings (carried from this session)
- ft-deepmetal @197583b. Merged+pushed: M15(2row), M15b(4row), E37 attn_sparse opt-in.
- Steady state (220 tok): decode_wall 134619ms w/ --fast-sparse-attn, 151426ms default. 1.446->1.627 tok/s.
- Leaf ranking steady: expert_forward 26.6%, attn_out 18.1%, attn_sparse 15.0%(now 3.3%), attn_qkv 8.9%,
  expert_wait 6.0%, shared_expert 5.8%, head 4.9%, router 4.8%, hc_norm 4.0%.
- c/deepseek_v4.c:4141-4162 prefill loop: attention batched over 64-token chunks
  (coli_v4_attention_window_batch_ref) BUT MoE is per-token: moe_token_pipeline() at :4154
  called once per item. No dedup of expert leases across tokens in a chunk.
- target_batch() :7528, chunk size 64 hardcoded at :7547 (offset += 64).
- expert_requests == tokens*layers*6 exactly (61662 ~ 240*43*6) => confirms no grouping today.
- MEASUREMENT PROBLEM: ttft is dominated by model LOAD (~40s), not prefill. Must isolate.

## Questions For User (ASK TOMORROW, DO NOT BLOCK)
1. (pending — none yet beyond scope confirmations)

## Now
Isolate true prefill cost from model-load cost; establish grouping factor S before building M4.

## Todo
see todowrite list

## Learnings
- 8-token gates are too short (3x this session). Use >=60 tokens for correctness gates.
- Always warm up after rebuild; cold first-run inflated numbers twice.
- generated_text is MULTI-LINE; grep '^generated_text=' compares only first line. Use awk block extract.

## Durability
Relocated from /tmp to repo (.backlog/ULW-NOTEPAD.md) 2026-08-14 ~01:30 per user:
/tmp is wiped on crash and this machine crashes. This file is COMMITTED and is the
authoritative resume point. Append only.

## Permissions granted by user
- Commit freely whenever work is verified + has results (no need to ask).
- Work autonomously; collect questions and ask them at "good morning"/"good afternoon".
